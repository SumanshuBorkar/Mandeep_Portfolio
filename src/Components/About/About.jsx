        <p style={{ fontSize: "25px", width: "80vw" }}>I am a cage searching for birds, bird shaping its own cage, and I, a chameleon, transform into what they seek. My identity flows like a restless tide, an embodiment of experiences, of imprints left by those who cross my path.</p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "25px", width: "80vw" }}>I dwell in the tension of dualities: the inanimate and the animate, the 0 and the 1, the black and the white. Yet, my truth lies in the spectrum between, the golden disturbance of Phiâ€”a whisper of perfection in chaos.</p>

        <p style={{ fontSize: "25px", width: "80vw" }}>I am the intersection of tangled hierarchies, the meeting of two infinite lines, where dreams teeter on the edge of dread. I am both the absence and the context, the silence and the sound. A reflection of the universe, shaped by its negation. A being, forever evolving, like a number line, zooming into infinity.</p>
        <p style={{ fontSize: "25px", width: "80vw" }}>

          I am what lingers in the spaces between.</p>
